It was developed by Valve and uses the Source engine, just like Counter-Strike: Source. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive features updated graphics and gameplay, as well as new features such as a competitive matchmaking system and a workshop where players can create and share custom content.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <div class="date">Who developed Counter-Strike?</div>
        <p class="q">The first Counter-Strike, the mod for Half-Life, was developed by Minh Le and Jess Cliffe. Most Counter-Strike games are developed by Valve, but Counter-Strike: Condition was developed by Turtle Rock Studios, and Nexon develops the Asian versions of Counter-Strike.</p>
        <div class="date">What platform is Counter-Strike released on?</div>
        <p class="q">Counter-Strike games have historically been primarily PC games, releasing first for Windows and later for OSX and Linux. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was also released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.</p>
        <div class="date">How does Counter-Strike differ from other first-person shooters?</div>
        <p class="q">Counter-Strike uses different mechanics than other first-person shooters. While most first-person-shooters include modes such as deathmatch (the number of kills determines the winner) or capture the flag (the winner brings the loser’s flag to their base), Counter-Strike’s assassination, hostage rescue, and bomb defusal modes–the most popular ones–require unique skills since the winner is not determined by simply killing everyone you see.</p>
        <div class="date">Does Counter-Strike allow mods?</div>
        <p class="q">Counter-Strike does allow players to mod the game to improve their own experience. It would be somewhat ironic if it didn’t, as the game was first spawned as a mod for Half-Life.</p>
        <div class="date">What was the prize pool of the first major Counter-Strike tournament?</div>
        <p class="q">The first major Counter-Strike tournament had a prize pool of $15,000.</p>
