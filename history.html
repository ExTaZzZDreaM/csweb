    <div class="date">COUNTER-STRIKE : WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW</div>
    
    <p class="q">Counter-Strike was first developed as a mod for Valve’s Half-Life game. Minh “Gooseman” Le and Jess “Cliffe” Cliffe developed the game in 1999. The mod’s popularity came to a head in 2000 when Valve acquired the mod with the intent to turn Counter-Strike into a full-fledged, standalone video game.

        The game centers around two groups of players: terrorists and counter-terrorists. Both teams typically complete goals to win the game against the other team. On the one hand, terrorists try to complete an act of terror, such as a bombing, while counter-terrorists try to stop them by disarming the bomb.
        
        Since the original release of Counter-Strike, several spin-offs and sequels have come out leading up to the most recent release. The latest installation, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, has received regular, comprehensive updates to the game, including new maps, modes, and balance changes for the last ten years.</p>

            <div class="date">COUNTER-STRIKE : CONDITION ZERO</div>
            <p class="q">Counter-Strike: Condition Zero followed the release of Counter-Strike. It was released in 2004 and received mixed reviews, unlike Counter-Strike, which was critically acclaimed. Condition Zero ran on Half-Life’s GoldSrc engine, just like the game before it.
     Condition Zero was developed by Turtle Rock Studios and contained a full in-universe campaign alongside its multiplayer modes.</p>

      <div class="date">COUNTER-STRIKE: SOURCE</div>
      <p class="q">Counter-Strike: Source was released in 2004 as a remake of the original Counter-Strike. It was developed by Valve and uses the Source engine, which was also used in Half-Life 2. Counter-Strike: Source features updated graphics and physics, as well as new gameplay features such as dynamic lighting and ragdoll physics.</p>

      <p class="q">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released in 2012 as the latest installment in the Counter-Strike series. It was developed by Valve and uses the Source engine, just like Counter-Strike: Source. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive features updated graphics and gameplay, as well as new features such as a competitive matchmaking system and a workshop where players can create and share custom content.</p>

      <p class="q">Counter-Strike Online is a free-to-play version of Counter-Strike that was developed by Nexon for the Asian market. It was released in 2007 and features a number of changes from the original game, such as new maps, weapons, and game modes.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <div class="date">Who developed Counter-Strike?</div>
        <p class="q">The first Counter-Strike, the mod for Half-Life, was developed by Minh Le and Jess Cliffe. Most Counter-Strike games are developed by Valve, but Counter-Strike: Condition was developed by Turtle Rock Studios, and Nexon develops the Asian versions of Counter-Strike.</p>
        <div class="date">What platform is Counter-Strike released on?</div>
        <p class="q">Counter-Strike games have historically been primarily PC games, releasing first for Windows and later for OSX and Linux. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was also released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.</p>
        <div class="date">How does Counter-Strike differ from other first-person shooters?</div>
        <p class="q">Counter-Strike uses different mechanics than other first-person shooters. While most first-person-shooters include modes such as deathmatch (the number of kills determines the winner) or capture the flag (the winner brings the loser’s flag to their base), Counter-Strike’s assassination, hostage rescue, and bomb defusal modes–the most popular ones–require unique skills since the winner is not determined by simply killing everyone you see.</p>
        <div class="date">Does Counter-Strike allow mods?</div>
        <p class="q">Counter-Strike does allow players to mod the game to improve their own experience. It would be somewhat ironic if it didn’t, as the game was first spawned as a mod for Half-Life.</p>
        <div class="date">What was the prize pool of the first major Counter-Strike tournament?</div>
        <p class="q">The first major Counter-Strike tournament had a prize pool of $15,000.</p>
