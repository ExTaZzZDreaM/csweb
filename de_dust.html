            Perhaps Dust II can be called the key map of CS:GO: it has been considered a classic since the very first version. This map reflects the essence of CS, and in today's update, we sought to respect its foundation while eliminating obvious flaws. We set the following goals:
 <ul>
<li>Improve the visibility of players around the map
<li>Smooth movement and cover
<li>Raise the graphic component to the level of modern maps
 </ul>
 Dust II is already available to everyone! Thank you for your feedback during the beta test. Below you will see the key changes to the map. Use the sliders to track the changes.        </div>

            Several overly dark corners in the tunnels are now illuminated by the sun breaking through the collapsed ceiling. In addition, we moved the car wreck at the planting point a bit to make it easier for players to bypass it. The hole in the wall - the “window” - has been expanded, and it has also become easier to move around next to it. Scaffolding nearby has been simplified: metal pipes will no longer obscure your prey. Also changed the position of several pillars outside the point, making this area look neater, but not less legible.        </div>

            Of the several skeletons of cars at point A, only one remained, and it became much easier to move around and on it. Now experienced players will not get stuck in the air, and beginners will not think that you can get burned on the car. We also replaced the unbearable fragments near the walls with much more predictable grass and stones - now you can safely walk on them.        </div>

            Here we also moved the dark passages, and eliminated the unpredictable cover at the door altogether. Now there are much fewer niches in the walls, so you don’t have to be distracted by trifles.        </div>

            The gameplay of the map still does not get old, but it clearly would not hurt to bring fresh sand to it. Now the point of bookmark B is near the ancient kasbah under restoration, and point A huddles next to a bazaar and a hotel. Texture resolution has been quadrupled, and North African environment models are available to all mapmakers. But there is also bad news: two pizzerias are gone. But now in their place are dentists. Coincidence? We don't think.        </div>

            The notorious fighters of the "Elite Division", the classic baddies of this map (also known as the "Dura Cell"), received an update to match their new home. The resolution of their textures has increased, and the models themselves have become more recognizable, holistic and iconic; these hardened veterans of countless battles still strive to take over the world. You will also notice that some of them like to visit our new hairdresser.        </div>
