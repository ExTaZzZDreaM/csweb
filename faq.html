                        VAC stands for Valve Anti-Cheat, an automated system designed to detect cheats installed on users' computers. If a user connects to a VAC secure server from a computer that has cheats installed, the VAC system will prevent the user from playing that game on VAC secure servers in the future.

                        At the moment, the developers do not provide a list of factors used in the Trust Factor matchmaking system. The developers don't want players to worry about any particular activity while playing CS:GO or other games on Steam. In addition, Trust Factor matchmaking will be constantly updated and any list of factors will become outdated very quickly. In general, the Trust Factor is determined by looking at the user's past experience on CS:GO and on Steam to ensure that the system is as accurate as possible.

                        Similar to the Elo rating in chess, CS:GO Competitive Skill Groups predict how well players will play against other players. Two equally qualified teams should, on average, win an equal number of matches when competing against each other.

                        The AK47 is the most powerful assault rifle in CS:GO and probably the best weapon you can find. But the saddest thing is that it is only available to the terrorist team. One magazine of this weapon can hold a maximum of 30 rounds. It costs around $2,700 and the recoil is very hard to control.

                        Dust2 is the most balanced map of all Counter-Strike maps. Whether you play as the attacking or defending side, it still remains balanced. On unbalanced maps like Nuke, the defense side is favored because there are too many camping spots that the attackers can't check one by one.

                        Two teams, terrorists and counter-terrorists, compete in various game modes to complete tasks on various "maps". At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their performance, earning virtual currency that can be spent on additional weapons or useful items.
